<p>Where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world?!

    I’ve both posed and answered this question numerous times over the years!
    Little did I know I would win a contest that gave me the opportunity to do so with someone else picking
    up the bill!</p>
    <p>Upon learning that I was one of the lucky Fiverr freelancers selected in the Anywhere Worker contest
         sponsored jointly by Fiverr and Selina Hostels - insert much excitement and celebration here!
        - I started out by talking with friends and family about where they would go if presented with such
        an opportunity. I received countless great ideas from others. Some would go to faraway cities long
        dreamed of, landmarks yearned to see, and once-in-a-lifetime experiences desired.</p>

<p><b>Staying in a time zone shared by the United States.</b></p>
<p>My business coaching clients and online learning students are primarily in the US so traveling to a time
     zone that coincided with the United States work day was a top priority. 
     Of course, this isn’t a consideration for everyone. About a decade before covid changed our lives, 
     my brother became the first digital nomad I knew! He had the good fortune to work remote for an employer who only required him to 
     have a dependable internet connection, make it to meetings, and complete his projects on time. He traveled the world during that
    time and I longed to do the same!</p>
    <p><b> Desire to visit a country I had never visited previously.         </b></p>
    <p> I chose to travel to a country I had never been to previously. While there is much more of Canada and Mexico I have yet to see,
         I have been to both countries previously. Some may prefer to travel to a country they have an affinity for and a level of comfort
        with. My preference was for the unknown. Given my top priority of staying in a US-friendly time zone, I narrowed my country search 
        to those in Central or South America. </p>
